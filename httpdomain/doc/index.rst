   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

:mod:`sphinxcontrib.httpdomain` --- Documenting RESTful HTTP APIs
=================================================================

This contrib extension, :mod:`sphinxcontrib.httpdomain`, provides a Sphinx
domain for describing RESTful HTTP APIs.

.. seealso::

   We might support reflection for web framework your webapp depends on.
   See the following :mod:`sphinxcontrib.auttohttp` modules:

   Module :mod:`sphinxcontrib.autohttp.flask`
      Reflection for Flask_ webapps.

   Module :mod:`sphinxcontrib.autohttp.bottle`
      Reflection for Bottle_ webapps.

In order to use it, add :mod:`sphinxcontrib.httpdomain` into
:data:`extensions` list of your Sphinx configuration file (:file:`conf.py`)::

    extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.httpdomain']


Basic usage
-----------

There are several provided :ref:`directives <directives>` that describe
HTTP resources.

.. sourcecode:: rst

   .. http:get:: /users/(int:user_id)/posts/(tag)

      The posts tagged with `tag` that the user (`user_id`) wrote.

      **Example request**:

      .. sourcecode:: http

         GET /users/123/posts/web HTTP/1.1
         Host: example.com
         Accept: application/json, text/javascript

      **Example response**:

      .. sourcecode:: http

         HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         Vary: Accept
         Content-Type: text/javascript

         [
           {
             "post_id": 12345,
             "author_id": 123,
             "tags": ["server", "web"],
             "subject": "I tried Nginx"
           },
           {
             "post_id": 12346,
             "author_id": 123,
             "tags": ["html5", "standards", "web"],
             "subject": "We go to HTML 5"
           }
         ]

      :query sort: one of ``hit``, ``created-at``
      :query offset: offset number. default is 0
      :query limit: limit number. default is 30
      :reqheader Accept: the response content type depends on
                         :mailheader:`Accept` header
      :reqheader Authorization: optional OAuth token to authenticate
      :resheader Content-Type: this depends on :mailheader:`Accept`
                               header of request
      :statuscode 200: no error
      :statuscode 404: there's no user

will be rendered as:

    .. http:get:: /users/(int:user_id)/posts/(tag)

       The posts tagged with `tag` that the user (`user_id`) wrote.

       **Example request**:

       .. sourcecode:: http

          GET /users/123/posts/web HTTP/1.1
          Host: example.com
          Accept: application/json, text/javascript

       **Example response**:

       .. sourcecode:: http

          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
          Vary: Accept
          Content-Type: text/javascript

          [
            {
              "post_id": 12345,
              "author_id": 123,
              "tags": ["server", "web"],
              "subject": "I tried Nginx"
            },
            {
              "post_id": 12346,
              "author_id": 123,
              "tags": ["html5", "standards", "web"],
              "subject": "We go to HTML 5"
            }
          ]

       :query sort: one of ``hit``, ``created-at``
       :query offset: offset number. default is 0
       :query limit: limit number. default is 30
       :reqheader Accept: the response content type depends on
                          :mailheader:`Accept` header
       :reqheader Authorization: optional OAuth token to authenticate
       :resheader Content-Type: this depends on :mailheader:`Accept`
                                header of request
       :statuscode 200: no error
       :statuscode 404: there's no user

Of course, :ref:`roles <roles>` that refer the directives as well.
For example:

.. sourcecode:: rst

   :http:get:`/users/(int:user_id)/posts/(tag)`

will render like:

    :http:get:`/users/(int:user_id)/posts/(tag)`


.. _directives:

.. _resource-fields:

Resource Fields
---------------

Inside HTTP resource description directives like :rst:dir:`get`,
reStructuredText field lists with these fields are recognized and formatted
nicely:

``param``, ``parameter``, ``arg``, ``argument``
   Description of URL parameter.

``queryparameter``, ``queryparam``, ``qparam``, ``query``
   Description of parameter passed by request query string.

   It optionally can be typed, all the query parameters will have obviously
   string types though.  But it's useful if there's conventions for it.

   .. versionchanged:: 1.1.9

      It can be typed e.g.:

      .. sourcecode:: rst

         :query string title: the post title
         :query string body: the post body
         :query boolean sticky: whether it's sticky or not

``formparameter``, ``formparam``, ``fparam``, ``form``
   Description of parameter passed by request content body, encoded in
   :mimetype:`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or
   :mimetype:`multipart/form-data`.

``jsonparameter``, ``jsonparam``, ``json``
   Description of a parameter passed by request content body, encoded in
   :mimetype:`application/json`.

   .. versionadded:: 1.1.8

   .. versionchanged:: 1.1.9

      It can be typed e.g.:

      .. sourcecode:: rst

         :jsonparam string title: the post title
         :jsonparam string body: the post body
         :jsonparam boolean sticky: whether it's sticky or not

``requestheader``, ``reqheader``
   Description of request header field.

``responseheader``, ``resheader``
   Description of response header field.

   .. versionadded:: 1.1.9

``statuscode``, ``status``, ``code``
   Description of response status code.

For example:

.. sourcecode:: rst

   .. http:post:: /posts/(int:post_id)

      Replies a comment to the post.

      :param post_id: post's unique id
      :type post_id: int
      :form email: author email address
      :form body: comment body
      :reqheader Accept: the response content type depends on
                         :mailheader:`Accept` header
      :reqheader Authorization: optional OAuth token to authenticate
      :resheader Content-Type: this depends on :mailheader:`Accept`
                               header of request

It will render like this:

    .. http:post:: /posts/(int:post_id)

       Replies a comment to the post.

                          :mailheader:`Accept` header
       :reqheader Authorization: optional OAuth token to authenticate
       :resheader Content-Type: this depends on :mailheader:`Accept`
                                header of request
       :status 302: and then redirects to :http:get:`/posts/(int:post_id)`
       :status 400: when form parameters are missing


.. _roles:

Roles
-----

.. rst:role:: http:options

   Refers to the :rst:dir:`http:options` directive.

.. rst:role:: http:head

   Refers to the :rst:dir:`http:head` directive.

.. rst:role:: http:post

   Refers to the :rst:dir:`http:post` directive.

.. rst:role:: http:get

   Refers to the :rst:dir:`http:get` directive.

.. rst:role:: http:put

.. rst:role:: http:delete

   Refers to the :rst:dir:`http:delete` directive.

.. rst:role:: http:trace

   Refers to the :rst:dir:`http:trace` directive.

.. rst:role:: http:statuscode

   A reference to a HTTP status code. The text "`code` `Status Name`" is
   generated; in the HTML output, this text is a hyperlink to a web reference
   of the specified status code.

   For example:

   .. sourcecode:: rst

      - :http:statuscode:`404`
      - :http:statuscode:`200 Oll Korrect`

   will be rendered as:

       - :http:statuscode:`404`
       - :http:statuscode:`200 Oll Korrect`

.. rst:role:: http:method

   A reference to a HTTP method (also known as *verb*). In the HTML output,
   this text is a hyperlink to a web reference of the specified HTTP method.

   For example:

   .. sourcecode:: rst

      It accepts :http:method:`post` only.

   It will render like this:

       It accepts :http:method:`post` only.

.. rst:role:: mimetype

   Exactly it doesn't belong to HTTP domain, but standard domain. It refers
   to the MIME type like :mimetype:`text/html`.

.. rst:role:: mailheader

   Similar to :rst:role:`mimetype` role, it doesn't belong to HTTP domain,
   but standard domain. It refers to the HTTP request/response header field
   like :mailheader:`Content-Type`.


.. module:: sphinxcontrib.autohttp.flask

:mod:`sphinxcontrib.autohttp.flask` --- Exporting API reference from Flask app
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.1

It generates RESTful HTTP API reference documentation from a Flask_
application's routing table, similar to :mod:`sphinx.ext.autodoc`.

In order to use it, add :mod:`sphinxcontrib.autohttp.flask` into
:data:`extensions` list of your Sphinx configuration (:file:`conf.py`) file::

    extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.autohttp.flask']

For example:

.. sourcecode:: rst

   .. autoflask:: autoflask_sampleapp:app
      :undoc-static:

will be rendered as:

    .. autoflask:: autoflask_sampleapp:app
       :undoc-static:

.. rst:directive:: .. autoflask:: module:app

   .. versionadded:: 1.1

   Generates HTTP API references from a Flask application. It takes an
   import name, like::

       your.webapplication.module:app

   Colon character (``:``) separates module path and application variable.
   Latter part can be more complex::

       your.webapplication.module:create_app(config='default.cfg')

   It's useful when a Flask application is created from the factory function
   (:func:`create_app`, in the above example).

   It takes several flag options as well.

   ``endpoints``
      Endpoints to generate a reference.

      .. sourcecode:: rst

         .. autoflask:: yourwebapp:app
            :endpoints: user, post, friends

      will document :func:`user`, :func:`post`, and :func:`friends`
      view functions, and

      .. sourcecode:: rst

         .. autoflask:: yourwebapp:app
            :endpoints:

      will document all endpoints in the flask app.

      For compatibility, omitting this option will produce the same effect
      like above.

      .. versionadded:: 1.1.8

   ``undoc-endpoints``
      Excludes specified endpoints from generated references.

      For example:

      .. sourcecode:: rst

         .. autoflask:: yourwebapp:app
            :undoc-endpoints: admin, admin_login

      will exclude :func:`admin`, :func:`admin_login` view functions.

      .. note::

         While the `undoc-members`_ flag of :mod:`sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension
         includes members without docstrings, ``undoc-endpoints`` option has
         nothing to do with docstrings. It just excludes specified endpoints.

         .. _undoc-members: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html#directive-automodule

   ``blueprints``
      Only include specified blueprints in generated references.

      .. versionadded:: 1.1.9

   ``undoc-blueprints``
      Excludes specified blueprints from generated references.

      .. versionadded:: 1.1.8

   ``undoc-static``
      Excludes a view function that serves static files, which is included
      in Flask by default.

   ``include-empty-docstring``
      View functions that don't have docstring (:attr:`__doc__`) are excluded
      by default. If this flag option has given, they become included also.

      .. versionadded:: 1.1.2

.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/



.. module:: sphinxcontrib.autohttp.bottle

:mod:`sphinxcontrib.autohttp.bottle` --- Exporting API reference from Bottle app
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It generates RESTful HTTP API reference documentation from a Bottle_
application's routing table, similar to :mod:`sphinx.ext.autodoc`.

In order to use it, add :mod:`sphinxcontrib.autohttp.bottle` into
:data:`extensions` list of your Sphinx configuration (:file:`conf.py`) file::

    extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.autohttp.bottle']

For example:

.. sourcecode:: rst

   .. autobottle:: autobottle_sampleapp:app

will be rendered as:

    .. autobottle:: autobottle_sampleapp:app

.. rst:directive:: .. autobottle:: module:app

   Generates HTTP API references from a Bottle application. It takes an
   import name, like::

       your.webapplication.module:app

   Colon character (``:``) separates module path and application variable.
   Latter part can be more complex::

       your.webapplication.module:create_app(config='default.cfg')

   It's useful when a Bottle application is created from the factory function
   (:func:`create_app`, in the above example).

   It takes several flag options as well.

   ``endpoints``
      Endpoints to generate a reference.

      .. sourcecode:: rst

         .. autobottle:: yourwebapp:app
            :endpoints: user, post, friends

      will document :func:`user`, :func:`post`, and :func:`friends`
      view functions, and

      .. sourcecode:: rst

         .. autobottle:: yourwebapp:app
            :endpoints:

      will document all endpoints in the flask app.

      For compatibility, omitting this option will produce the same effect
      like above.

   ``undoc-endpoints``
      Excludes specified endpoints from generated references.

      For example:

      .. sourcecode:: rst

         .. autobottle:: yourwebapp:app
            :undoc-endpoints: admin, admin_login

      will exclude :func:`admin`, :func:`admin_login` view functions.

      .. note::

         While the `undoc-members`_ flag of :mod:`sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension
         includes members without docstrings, ``undoc-endpoints`` option has
         nothing to do with docstrings. It just excludes specified endpoints.

         .. _undoc-members: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html#directive-automodule

   ``include-empty-docstring``
      View functions that don't have docstring (:attr:`__doc__`) are excluded
      by default. If this flag option has given, they become included also.
