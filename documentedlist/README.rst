DocumentedList Sphinx Extension
===============================

This file provides a Sphinx extension to convert a Python list into
a table in the generated documentation. The intended application of
this extension is to document the items of essentially list-like
objects of immutable data (possibly enums, though python 3.4 enums
are not supported yet).

In the source code, each list item, instead of being just it's native
data type, should be replaced by a tuple of two elements. The second
element of the tuple should be a string which provides a description
for the item.

In the first use of this extension, the aim is to document a list of
supported device classes (each of which is a string). This was
originally specified in the python code as a list, and the same list
with descriptions was manually maintained (or, in reality, left
unmaintained) in the corresponding documentation. The list is now
replaced with a tuple containing both the recognized strings and the
description for each, and Sphinx is able to use this extension to
'autogenerate' the table in the documentation.

Installation & Usage
--------------------

To use this module, place the ``documentedlist.py`` file somewhere in
the ``PYTHONPATH`` that Sphinx is configured to use, or add the git
checkout folder to the ``PYTHONPATH`` in Sphinx's ``conf.py``.

In the .rst file where the table should appear, insert the Sphinx
directive provided by this module :

    .. code-block:: rest

        .. documentedlist::
            :listobject: full.importable.path.of.thelist

This extension will import the list as :

    .. code-block:: python

        from full.importable.path.of import thelist

For a usage example, see:

and the corresponding documentation generated at:
